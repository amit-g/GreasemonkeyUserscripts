Chessboards Printing
====================

This is a Greasemonkey Userscript to add a "Print Chessboards" link to chess.com pages. When that link is clicked everything in the pages except the chessboards are removed. The chessboards then can be printed. In firefox, to print the backgrounds the option File->Page setup->Print Background (color & images) has to be selected.
